   - Secondary: "Ask the coach" → Coach chat

### Phase 11 - Card-Based Detailed Analysis (Feb 5, 2026) ✅
**Transformed detailed analysis from dense report to mobile card experience**

**Route:** `/workout/{id}/analysis`

**Structure (6 cards):**
1. **Header - Session Context**
   - Session name
   - 1 sentence max context
   - Example: "Sustained outing, noticeably more intense than your recent routine."

2. **Execution Card** (3 columns)

- 100% EN or 100% FR
- No language mixing allowed

### Phase 13 - Decision Assistant Dashboard (Feb 7, 2026) ✅
**Redesigned dashboard from data display to decision assistant**

**Philosophy:** CardioCoach is NOT a data dashboard. It's a decision assistant.
User should always know: "Am I doing too much?", "Am I doing too little?", "What should I do next?"

**Structure (Mobile-first, glanceable in <5 seconds):**

1. **Coach Insight** (top priority, blue highlight)
   - 1 sentence only, max 15 words
   - Action-oriented, tells user what to do
   - Examples: "Low load this week; add an easy session to maintain progress."

2. **This Week** (3 cards)
   - Sessions: count of workouts
   - Volume: total km
   - Load Signal: Low (orange) / Balanced (green) / High (red)
   - NO HR numbers, NO pace numbers - only interpreted signals

3. **Last 30 Days** (compact summary)
   - Total volume (km)
   - Active weeks count
   - Trend: Up (green ↗) / Stable (gray −) / Down (orange ↘)
   - NO daily breakdown, NO charts

4. **Recent Workouts** (compact list)
   - Last 4 workouts
   - Name, date, distance, duration
   - Links to workout detail

**Backend:**
- `GET /api/dashboard/insight` - Returns coach_insight, week stats, month stats
- Load signal thresholds: >80km=high, >40km=balanced, else=low
- Trend calculation: >15% change=up/down, else=stable

**Design Rules:**
- Signal over data: no raw statistics without interpretation
- No walls of text, no reports
- If it looks like a training report, it is WRONG
- Coach tone: calm, human, concise

**Backend:**
- `GET /api/coach/workout-analysis/{workout_id}` - Mobile coach view
- Returns: coach_summary, intensity, load, session_type, insight, guidance
- Session type calculated from HR + load + zone distribution

**Design Rules:**
- Readable in under 10 seconds
- Feels coached, not analyzed
- One idea per block
- Max 2 lines per text block
- No stars, no heavy markdown
- White space > density

### Phase 14 - High-Value Features (Feb 9, 2026) ✅
**3 coach-level features to increase personalization and engagement**

#### 1. Recovery Score (Dashboard Only)
**Purpose:** Help user decide if they should train hard or rest today.

**Display:** Circular gauge on dashboard
- Score: 0-100
- Status: ready (green, ≥75), moderate (amber, 50-74), low (red, <50)
- Coach phrase: One sentence recommendation

**Calculation factors:**
- Days since last workout (more rest = higher score)
- Load ratio vs baseline week
- Hard sessions in last 3 days
- Session spread across days

**Backend:**
- `calculate_recovery_score()` function in server.py
- Added `recovery_score` field to `/api/dashboard/insight` response

**Frontend:**
- `RecoveryGauge` component with SVG circular progress
- Displayed on Dashboard between coach insight and week stats

#### 2. Recommendations Follow-up
**Purpose:** Track if user followed last week's advice and provide feedback.

**Display:** Card in Weekly Review (Bilan) showing:
- "Last week's advice" header
- 1 sentence feedback on whether user followed recommendations

**Implementation:**
- Fetch previous digest from DB to get last recommendations
- Pass `followup_context` to AI prompt
- AI generates `recommendations_followup` field

**Example:**
- "Tu as bien fait la sortie longue, mais tu n'as pas ajouté la troisième sortie facile comme prévu."

#### 3. Personal Goal (Event with Date)
**Purpose:** Allow user to set a target event so coach can adapt recommendations.

**Enhanced Goal Fields:**
- **Event name:** Text (e.g., "Marathon de Paris")
- **Distance type:** Selector with 5 options:
  - 5km (5.0km)
  - 10km (10.0km)
  - Semi-marathon (21.1km)
  - Marathon (42.195km)
  - Ultra Trail (50.0km default)
- **Event date:** Calendar picker
- **Target time:** Optional, hours:minutes format (e.g., 3h45)
- **Target pace:** Auto-calculated from distance and time (e.g., 5:19/km)

**Display:**
- Settings page: Full goal card with distance, date, target time, and pace
- Weekly Review: Compact goal card showing event name, distance, days until, and TARGET PACE

**Backend:**
- Collection: `user_goals`
- Model: `UserGoal(id, user_id, event_name, event_date, distance_type, distance_km, target_time_minutes, target_pace, created_at)`
- Helper: `calculate_target_pace(distance_km, target_time_minutes)` → "5:19" format
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/user/goal` - Get user's goal
  - `POST /api/user/goal` - Set/replace goal with pace calculation
  - `DELETE /api/user/goal` - Delete goal

**AI Adaptation:**
- Goal context includes distance and target pace
- Coach recommendations adapt to timeline AND pace
- Example: "À 55 jours du marathon avec un objectif de 3h45, tes sorties devraient inclure 20 minutes à l'allure cible (5:19/km)"

**Test Report:** `/app/test_reports/iteration_17.json` (100% pass rate)

**Test Report:** Validated via curl and screenshots

### Phase 23 - RAG DETAILED STRAVA DATA (Feb 2026) ✅
**Enrichissement RAG avec données Strava détaillées (splits, laps, HR streams)**

**Objective:** Utiliser les données détaillées de Strava (splits par km, flux HR, cadence) dans le moteur RAG pour des analyses plus profondes et personnalisées.

**What Changed:**

1. **Backend - Strava Sync Enrichment** (`/app/backend/server.py`)
   - `fetch_strava_activity_laps()` - Fetch lap data (splits per km)
   - `fetch_strava_activity_streams()` - Fetch HR, cadence, pace streams
   - `process_strava_laps()` - Convert laps to splits array
   - `process_strava_streams()` - Extract per-km detailed data
   - `enrich_workout_with_detailed_data()` - Add split_analysis, hr_analysis, cadence_analysis to workouts
   - Updates existing workouts during sync (not just insert new ones)

2. **Data Fields Added to Workouts:**
   - `splits[]` - Per-km splits with pace_str, avg_hr, avg_cadence, elevation_gain
   - `split_analysis{}` - fastest_km, slowest_km, pace_drop, consistency_score, negative_split
   - `hr_analysis{}` - min_hr, avg_hr, max_hr, hr_drift
   - `cadence_analysis{}` - min_cadence, max_cadence, avg_cadence, cadence_stability
   - `km_splits[]` - Detailed per-km data from streams
   - `hr_stream_sample[]`, `cadence_stream_sample[]` - Sampled stream data for RAG

3. **RAG Engine Updates** (`/app/backend/rag_engine.py`)
   - `generate_workout_analysis_rag()` now uses split_analysis for pacing feedback
   - Generates splits_text with first/last km comparison
   - Generates hr_drift_text with hydration recommendations
   - Generates cadence_text with technique feedback
   - Compares splits with previous similar workouts (splits_comparison)
   - Returns rag_sources indicating what detailed data was used

4. **Frontend - WorkoutDetail.jsx**
   - **NEW: Split Analysis Card** (`data-testid="split-analysis-card"`)
     - Blue background (bg-blue-500/10)
     - Shows fastest/slowest km with pace
     - Shows pace drop in s/km
     - Shows consistency score percentage
     - Shows negative split indicator
   - **NEW: HR Analysis Card** (`data-testid="hr-analysis-card"`)
     - Red background (bg-red-500/10)
     - Shows min/avg/max HR in bpm
     - Shows HR drift with hydration warning when >10 bpm
   - **Comparison section** now shows splits_comparison text

**Example Split Analysis Card:**
```
ANALYSE DES SPLITS
Km le + rapide: Km 3 (7:13)    Km le + lent: Km 10 (11:11)
Écart allure: +238s/km         Régularité: 60%
```

**Example HR Analysis Card:**
```
ANALYSE CARDIAQUE
Min: 86 bpm    Moy: 128 bpm    Max: 139 bpm
Dérive cardiaque: +25 bpm (Hydratation à surveiller)
```

**Test Report:** `/app/test_reports/iteration_21.json` (100% pass rate - 43 backend + 11 frontend tests)

### P1 - High Priority (Next)
- Allow user to configure personal max HR in Settings

### P2 - Medium Priority
- Recovery score calculation based on training load ✅ (implemented)
- "Ask about this insight" follow-up capability
- Weekly/monthly summary emails
- Export training data (CSV/JSON)
- Display VMA/VO2max estimation in Settings UI (backend API ready)

### P3 - Nice to Have
- Additional languages (German, Spanish)
- Apple Health/Google Fit sync
- Better WebLLM models when available (current small models produce poor quality)

### Deprioritized
- Garmin activation (dormant)
- server.py refactoring (post-MVP)

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI, MongoDB, emergentintegrations
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, Shadcn/UI
- AI: OpenAI GPT-5.2 via Emergent LLM key
- i18n: Custom React Context with explicit EN/FR dictionaries

## Design System
- Theme: Obsidian Tactical
- Fonts: Barlow Condensed (headings), Manrope (body), JetBrains Mono (data)
- Primary: #3B82F6 (Electric Blue)
- Background: #050505 (Deep Black)
