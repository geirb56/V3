Dashboard now shows: 1) Coach Insight at top (blue highlight, 1 sentence, max 15 words, action-oriented), 2) This Week (3 cards: Sessions, Volume km, Load signal Low/Balanced/High), 3) Last 30 Days (compact: Total km, Active weeks, Trend Up/Stable/Down), 4) Recent workouts list with links to workout detail. No HR or pace numbers visible. Full EN/FR support working correctly.",
